Remote Procedure Calls ([JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification)) sent over any [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)-based transport.  [WebWorkers](/transports/worker), [WebSockets](/transports/websocket), [MQTT](/transports/mqtt), and more!

## Installation

`npm install rawr`


## Using rawr with a webworker

Every rawr client can act as both a client and a server, and make RPC calls in either direction.

For example, if we want to use rawr to make calls to a webworker:
```javascript
import rawr from 'rawr';
import { dom } from 'rawr/tansports/worker';

const myWorker = new Worker('/my-worker.js');

const peer = rawr({transport: dom(myWorker)});

const result = await peer.methods.doSomething('lots of data');
```

Our WebWorker code might look something like:
```javascript
import rawr from 'rawr';
import { worker } from 'rawr/tansports/worker';

const peer = rawr({transport: worker(), handlers: {doSomething}});

function doSomething(inputData) {
  // do some heavy lifting in this thread
  // return a result
}
```

## Using rawr with a websocket

We could even to this type of call to a remote server such as a websocket.
Simply use a differnt transport:
```javascript
import rawr from 'rawr';
import wsTransport from 'rawr/tansports/websocket';

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

ws.onopen = (event) => {
  // create the rawr peer
  const peer = rawr({transport: wsTransport(ws)});
};
```

The websocket server could even make arbitrary calls to the client!
```javascript
socketServer.on('connection', (socket) => {
  const peer = rawr({ transport: wsTransport(socket) })

  const val = await peer.methods.doSomethingOnClient();
  
});
```

## Handling Notifications

Peers can also send each other notifications:

```javascript
peer.notifiers.saySomething('hello');
```

Receiving those notifications from another peer is just as simple:
```javascript
peer.notifications.onsaySomething((words) => {
  console.log(words); //hello
});
```
